Petya succeeds in mathematics better than anyone in the class, so the 
teacher asked him a difficult homework, in which you need to find the 
sum of all positive elements in a given set of integers, then find 
where the maximum and minimum elements are in the given sequence and 
calculate the product of the numbers located in this sequences between 
them. It is also known that the minimum and maximum elements occur in a 
given set of numbers only once and are not adjacent. Since the teacher 
gave Petya about `100` problems of this kind, Petya, as a strong 
programmer, was able to write a program that independently finds a 
solution based on a given set of numbers. Are you weak?

##Input
The first line of the input file `INPUT.TXT` contains a single number 
`N` - the number of elements in the array. The second line contains `N` 
integers representing the given array. All elements of the array are 
separated by a space. Each of the numbers in the input file, including `N`,
 does not exceed `10^2` in absolute value.

##Output
In a single line of the output file `OUTPUT.TXT`, you need to output 
two numbers separated by a space: the sum of positive elements and 
the product of numbers located between the minimum and maximum elements. 
The sum and product values do not exceed `3*10^4` in absolute value.
